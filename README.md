# Custom-AI-using-Wordpress-Plugin
At tech, we’re on the lookout for a skilled developer to help us build a cool custom AI use-case samples with our WordPress Plugin. If you know your way around WordPress, we want you on our team! You’ll be teaming up with us to nail down what we need and create some cool sample custom trained ai within the website. We have a developer version of plugin which will allow you to think corporate level, developing your own added value to the tech. If you think you have the skill and interest let’s have a chat! We are launching very soon so the need is now.
-----------------
 we’ll focus on how you can leverage Python for backend processing, training AI models, and integrating them with WordPress.

However, keep in mind that WordPress is typically PHP-based, so you would interact with Python AI scripts via an API or external backend service. Below is a basic Python script example that can be part of an AI use case (for example, training a custom AI model) and can be linked to a WordPress website via API calls.

Here’s a basic outline of how you might approach this:
Step 1: Python Script for AI Model Training/Use Case

import numpy as np
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
import pickle

# Load dataset (using iris dataset for example)
data = load_iris()
X = data.data
y = data.target

# Split data into training and test sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a model
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Save the model for later use
with open('model.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(model, f)

print("Model training complete and saved as 'model.pkl'")

Step 2: Python API to Serve AI Model

To integrate this AI model into a WordPress plugin, you can use Flask to serve this model through an API.

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
import pickle

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load the trained model
with open('model.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    # Get data from the request
    data = request.get_json()
    features = np.array(data['features']).reshape(1, -1)
    
    # Make prediction
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    
    # Return prediction as a JSON response
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction[0]})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

This Flask API listens for POST requests and predicts based on the model you've trained.
Step 3: WordPress Integration

On the WordPress side, you would interact with this API to send data and retrieve predictions. Here’s a basic example using JavaScript to make API requests from WordPress.

    Create a custom plugin in WordPress (or use an existing one).
    Add AJAX functionality to send data to the Python API.

WordPress PHP Plugin Example:

function ai_predictor_plugin_enqueue_scripts() {
    wp_enqueue_script('ai-predictor', plugin_dir_url(__FILE__) . 'js/ai_predictor.js', array('jquery'), null, true);
    wp_localize_script('ai-predictor', 'aiPredictor', array('api_url' => 'http://your-python-api-url/predict'));
}
add_action('wp_enqueue_scripts', 'ai_predictor_plugin_enqueue_scripts');

function ai_predictor_shortcode() {
    return '<button id="ai-predictor-btn">Get Prediction</button>';
}
add_shortcode('ai_predictor', 'ai_predictor_shortcode');

JavaScript (in js/ai_predictor.js):

jQuery(document).ready(function($) {
    $('#ai-predictor-btn').click(function() {
        let features = [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2];  // Example features for the Iris dataset

        $.ajax({
            url: aiPredictor.api_url,
            type: 'POST',
            contentType: 'application/json',
            data: JSON.stringify({ features: features }),
            success: function(response) {
                alert('Prediction: ' + response.prediction);
            },
            error: function(xhr, status, error) {
                console.log('Error: ' + error);
            }
        });
    });
});

Step 4: Testing and Deployment

    Ensure your Python API is running and accessible from the WordPress site.
    You may need to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) on your Flask API to allow requests from your WordPress domain.

Summary:

    Python AI Model: Train a model using libraries like sklearn and save it using pickle.
    Flask API: Create an API to serve the model’s predictions.
    WordPress Integration: Use a custom WordPress plugin that sends data to the Python API and displays the result.

With this setup, you can easily add custom AI use-cases to your WordPress site with the KISSAi Plugin by integrating AI model predictions into your pages.
